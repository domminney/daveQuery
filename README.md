My jQuery Replacement

I have been using jQuery for years. I used to work doing web development full time until leaving to join a band.
During the pandemic I've been brushing up my skills and one thing I find myself using is jQuery.

Everybody moans at me to move away from jQuery and after watching Kyle from Web Deb Simplified writing a jQuery clone
I thought it was time to write the things I like and try to move away from jQuery.

I have written it for my own use but feel free to contribute, expand it or fix my bugs!

Thanks

Dave
